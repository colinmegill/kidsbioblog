# The Equine Species

The Equine Species

By: Eva Lae

Horses have been around for 50 million years. They didn’t always look the same, but they were the beginning of what we call today, The Equine Species.

Horses, to say the least, are fascinating creatures. They can carry ten percent of their own body weight, and are used for a wide variety of things today. Let’s go on an adventure to find out more about these creatures.

There are different kinds of methods for riding horses. These methods are called disciplines. A couple of disciplines are Dressage, a complicated series of steps and transitions, and Jumping, where you jump over poles and fences of different heights and materials.

The experience of a horse show

Lets go to a horse show. At the show there are sleek and beautiful Arabians, and tall thoroughbreds prancing in the warm up ring. Looking around there are more rings scattered across the space. In one, a large golden horse, called a buckskin, with a black mane and tail performed a complicated series of steps and ending with a smart salute to the judges, much to the thrill of the crowd. In another ring there is a big dappled gray mare jumping red and white striped jumps about four feet high. The gray executes each jump perfectly, only stumbling on the penultimate one, her hooves clipping the rail. The crowd said: ohhh. When the mare and her rider made the last jump perfectly, the horse was seamless and the rider made invisible commands to her mare, whose name was Silver Moon.

Experience at the Racetrack

Next thing you know, a train is pulling up in front of the racetrack. The jockeys, or people who ride on the horses back during a race, are warming up their horses. The thoroughbreds are gleaming in the twelve o’ clock sun and their muscles are rippling as they take up a steady trot. Twenty minutes later the horses burst out of their metal stalls and sped down the track. The people all around are cheering loudly, shouting encouragement. Racehorse names are floating around, Choir’s Carnival, Sparks Fly, Rookie Queen. Racehorse names can NEVER be used more than once in a horses life, and the ones who win the most races? Their names can never ever be used again. Even after the horse is dead.

Horse Ranch Experience

The race is over and your train is back again. The next stop is a farm about 10 miles away. Rach horses graze and run in pastures. The scenery is beautiful, but first to see the horses. There is a spotted horse, called a pinto, a horse that has blobs of brown looking like paint, this horse is called a paint. The horses are halterless, their manes and tails free from braids and their manes are waving wildly in the wind. It is quite different from the spotlessly manicured animals from the Horse Show and the Racetrack. A young girl walks into the pasture with a bridle that she drapes over the fence. She calls to the paint and slips the bridle over his head, then she climbs onto his bck without a saddle. This is called riding bareback. Ranch life really is different from everything else you saw today.
The train next stops at a house with white paint and green trim. This is the end of the adventure.

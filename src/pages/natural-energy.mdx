An article by Dante about how Natural Energy helps lessen the impact Fossil Fuels have on the environment.

Natural Energy
By Dante

All across the planet, the world is heating up because of fossil fuels like oil and coal. These fuels emit Co2 (Carbon Dioxide). Co2 rises up into space, thickens the atmosphere, and, as a result, traps more heat. This causes our planet to warm up. This is called Global Warming, or Climate Change. Natural fuels can help with this problem by reducing the amounts of Co2 emitted.

Some natural energy sources include solar energy, wind energy, and hydro energy.

Solar energy is energy collected from the sun. The most popular way to harness this type of energy is using solar panels. Solar panels are dark blue panes made of silicon. Silicon is a material made out of sand. The solar panels are pointed at a precise angle facing the sun to create energy at a certain time every day. For example, a solar panel pointed towards the east might collect energy from 7am-10am because of where the sun rises.

Wind energy is an endless source of clean energy. It is created by windmills. To create electricity, turbines work generators which then give electricity out around the world. The only problem is that windmills take lots of time and money to make. Luckily there are lots of natural energy donation programs.

Biomass energy is made by turning solid fuels made from plants into electricity. Although biomass involves burning organic materials to make electricity,however it is, nowadays, a much cleaner, energy-efficient process. By converting agricultural, industrial and domestic wastes into fuels like solid, liquid and gas fuels, biomass generates energy at a very low economical and environmental cost.

Hydro energy is a renewable energy source that is one of the most commercially used. By making a dam or barrier, a big reservoir can be used to create a controlled flow of water that drives a turbine, generating power. Hydro energy is often more reliable than solar or wind energy, especially when it is tidal. This type of energy can also be stored.

Recyclable energy is a type of renewable energy that does not emit Co2 and is much better for the environment, although it is more expensive to generate than fossil fuels. Possibly one of the most efficient and popular ways to make natural energy fuels is by using algae farms. than fossil fuels. more expensive to generate

Possibly one of the most important natural energy sources are algae farms. algae farms take up tons of space, however algae takes in carbon dioxide and can be used as fuel.
There are many natural energy resources which our country could focus on to support environmental health.

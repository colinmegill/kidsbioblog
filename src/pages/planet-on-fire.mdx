At the moment, Planet earth is at least partially, on fire. The number of fires in the US have gone up drastically since 1983. Today, in 2020, wildfires in California and Oregon are setting records for the biggest ever in those areas. “I was stuck inside for eight days because of wilfire smoke,” said Dante, age nine. “The smoke was so thick I couldn’t do anything outdoors, even open my windows.” Hear that? The bottom line is, we need to do something about these fires.

##### SOME FIRES THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

In 1989 the manitoba fires burned over 8,000,000 acres. These fires caused 24,500 people to evacuate, causing over 100 homes to be destroyed. That is too many people’s lives going down the drain in only a few days. People like you and me can help stop these fires by simply reading this article, or educating themselves on the ways of wildfires and how to help the victims of them.

Think about how you would feel if your house went up in smoke, then your neighborhood burned, and then your favorite restaurants, parks, and schools, and finally your entire town up and gone because of a wildfire. This is what happened to Paradise, California. The entire town burned down in a massive wildfire covering 153,000 acres of land, and destroying 18,804 buildings.

##### NOW FOR SOME SOLUTIONS

It is a general assumption that all fires are bad and do damage. The fires you just heard about are some of the worst, but there are a lot of fires that do not very much damage. Did you know that redwood forests actually need fire to survive? It’s true, they can’t reproduce unless all the brush droppings around their seedlings are burned , which signals the seedling to grow. These fires help the environment but a lot of them don’t. Which is why we need to stop these big fires and keep the small ones. Think about campfires, are those damaging or a fun way to warm you up after a long hike or adventure through the woods? Native Americans used to use controlled burning to burn the grass on the plains near where they lived so that when wildfires came through there was nothing left to burn. This kind of thing could still work today, it’s called controlled burning. Meaning that we burn parts of forests that are prone to fires using fire that we can easily put out. This is just one way of keeping there from being large patches of trees in which fire can easily spread.

##### WHAT MADE FIRE SIZE CHANGE DRASTICALLY FOR THE WORSE?

Firstly, it was the fact that people were logging more and more trees,the first thing is that natural patches broke out throughout forests, this helped the fires have no trees to spread through, the second thing is that since people were logging more, meaning that a lot of people were like, we are going to lose all our trees, we have to plant more. So then people planted more trees closer and closer together. This meant that when the summer wildfires came through, There were once again plenty of trees to spread to.

##### AN ENDING I HOPE YOU GET SOMETHING OUT OF

In conclusion to all that you have just read, there are things we can do to help wildfire evacuees and people who have had their homes burned. You can speak up on the fact that more trees might not be the best thing ever. This article focused on a pretty general overview of wildfires, you can learn more on sites like Wikipedia and on a Google Browser. I hope you enjoyed this article and that you are interested in helping other people in stopping these dangerous fires.
